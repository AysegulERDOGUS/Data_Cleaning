# Data_Cleaning

In this project, raw data was cleaned and structured using SQL. Incorrect data entries were corrected, missing values were filled, and inconsistencies were resolved. The data was structurally organized and formats were standardized before being made suitable for analysis. As a result, a reliable and accurate dataset was created, ready for analysis and reporting processes.
